			<h3>Tips</h3> 
			<ul>
				<li>Buy Local: Support local businesses and restaurants, you don't need to go to Taco Bell when you're on vacation.</li>
				<li>Don't take anything: Especially don't take lava rocks. Not only is it disrepectful, but according to legends, you will receive bad luck until you return the rocks back.</li>
				<li>Read signs and follow reccommendations.</li>
				<li>Don't swim in certain areas if you don't feel comfortable or aren't a strong swimmer.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In general, if you don't know the area don't try to be adventurous and trust locals advice. Since Hawaii is reliant on tourism, support local businesses where you can and give back to the community.</p>
